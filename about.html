        <p>
          Ever since I was a kid, creating new things always got me excited.
          However, at that time I didn't have enough resources to pursue the
          same. That passion drove me to pursue engineering, where I was exposed
          to a plethora of resources and knowledge. I was fascinated by the
          evolving technology, which was developing new and innovative ideas
          every now and then. In the beginning, it was difficult to get used to
          coding, however, during the lock down I started reading about new
          technology, which gave me a massive boost to learn more about the
          industry and pursue a career. With the same fascination that drove me
          as kid, I am learning MERN stack at Masai School. It is here that I
          learned that the field of coding is ever-growing. I am proficient in
          the following technical skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, React.
          Outside of coding, I am a traveler and enjoy playing table tennis and
          badminton.
